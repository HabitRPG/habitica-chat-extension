**A habitica.com Chat Client for Chrome and Firefox**

---

Hi, and thanks for contributing to this humble project!

This is an official Habitica (HabitRPG) Chrome and Firefox Extension that it is maintained only by volunteer contributors to Habitica. This code is not maintained by staff.

# Development

Since the Chrome and Firefox extensions are almost identical, we use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify) to maintain a single source code to build both extensions.  To get started, install Node and npm on your computer and run:

```bash
npm install
```

The code resides in the `src` directory. Once the code is built for Chrome and Firefox, they will appear in the `chrome` and `firefox` folders. You can build the extensions with:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you're doing development work, and want to build new versions of the extension as you make changes, you can run the following:

```bash
npm run dev
```

# Releasing

When a staff member is ready to release the extension, run the following command (use minor if a new feature was added or patch if only bugfixes were added):

```
npm version minor|patch
```

This will update the package.json version and tag the release in git. It will also build a new version of the extension with the new version. 

It is important when completing changes to firefox to zip the files (not the folder but the files themselves) as described in this [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Package_your_extension). 

# Helpful Notes
+ Coding requirements for porting chrome extensions to firefox can be found in [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Porting_a_Google_Chrome_extension).  

+ To make it easier on staff please ensure you update this ReadMe file with the latest version changes. This will be used for the release notes.
